3.	Sample JSON Request/Response format is as mentioned below:

      #1. JSON payload for request from FMS to CxECRDial
      
            {
              "reqId": "<unique alphanumeric id>",
              "ticketNo": "<ticket_no>",
              "mainSchedule": "<Date/Time>",
              "reminder1Schedule": "<Date/Time>",
              "reminder2Schedule": "<Date/Time>",
              "ttsText": "<speechtext>",
              "Task": [
                {
                  "taskId": "<task id string>",
                  "dialDN": "<phone no to dial>",
                  "reminder1Flag": "true/false",
                  "reminder2Flag": "true/false",
                  "ackFlag": "true/false"
                },
                {
                  "taskId": "<task id string>",
                  "dialDN": "<phone no to dial>",
                  "reminder1Flag": "true/false",
                  "reminder2Flag": "true/false",
                  "ackFlag": "true/false"
                }
              ]
            }


      #2. JSON payload for response from CxECRDial to FMS

            {
              "ticketNo": "<ticket_no>",
              "taskId": "<task id string>",
              "dialType": "<main/reminder1/reminder2>",
              "attemptCount": "<numric. retyr attempts made>",
              "callStatus":"success/failed",
              "callDuration":"<time in sec>",
              "ack":"<true/false>"
            }
